## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Three-Step Flow

**Step 1: User Creates Permission (Frontend)**
- User connects wallet
- User sets allowance (e.g., 0.01 ETH per month)
- User signs message (NO GAS FEE!)
- Permission + signature created

**Step 2: Backend Approves Permission (Backend)**
- Backend receives permission + signature
- Backend calls smart contract
- Contract verifies and stores permission
- Backend pays gas fee
- Permission now ACTIVE

**Step 3: Backend Spends from Permission (Backend)**
- Backend decides to charge user
- Backend calls smart contract
- Contract transfers ETH from user to backend
- Backend pays gas fee
- Can repeat until allowance exhausted

---

## 🔑 Important Points

### For Users
- ✅ Sign once, get charged automatically
- ✅ Never pay gas fees
- ✅ Set your own spending limits
- ✅ Can revoke anytime
- ✅ Protected by smart contract

### For Developers
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Recurring payments made easy
- ✅ Backend pays all gas fees
- ✅ Enforced by smart contract
- ✅ Works on multiple chains
